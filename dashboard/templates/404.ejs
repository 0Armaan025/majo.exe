<p style="display: none;">Cariiii i love you &lt;3... I would do everything for you. I love you more than anything. Even though you made my heart hurt.. But between us came someone you care about more than me... You love him, you leave me in the shadow of your love. He's lying. He loves you only for your appearance.. I'm honest with you and I love you for that disgusting but beautiful too character. You're the most important person to me even though I'm telling you this for the millionth time. If you're reading this, know that I love you and that I would give my life for you.. PS.. that emote at the top is your edit.... You did it when everything was good between us (well almost).. </p>
